# Project Overview

An RSS feeder app that was already implemented by another developer, who has included jasmine testing framework and barely started writing tests for the application.


## Goal

To get familiar with jasmine testing framework and test-driven development and to finish writing tests for the application.

## What was done

* All the required tests were implemented and each test was commented in detail.
* An additional test for filtering feeds was written.
* A new feed filter functionality was implemented and tested against the tests written for it.
* Most of the work is contained in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file, however there are amendments in css/style.css, index.html and js/app.js files for the additional (beyond the requirements) functionality.

## What did I learn

I have learnt:

* what Test Driven Development is and how it helps to avoid bugs and errors even before the application code is written;
* what Jasmine testing framework is and how to write tests in it;
* how to analyze the errors reported by the testing framework and how it helps to debug and fix them.

# How to run the application
